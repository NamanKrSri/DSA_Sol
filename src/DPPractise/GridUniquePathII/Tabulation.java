/*
Given a 'N' * 'M' maze with obstacles, count and return the number
of paths to reach the right-bottom cell from the top-left cell. A cell
in the given maze has a value -1 if it is a blockage or dead-end, else
0. From a given cell, we are allowed to move to cells (i+1, j) and (i.
j+1) only. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7.
